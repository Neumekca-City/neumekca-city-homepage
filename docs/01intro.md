## About Katana Zero
:::note
Katana Zero is a 2D action platform video game developed by Askiisoft and published by Devolver Digital for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Nintendo Switch in 2019. The game was also released on Xbox One on October 15, 2020.
Katana Zero includes no health bar and being hit will result in instant death. The player character navigates side-scrolling levels, attempting to kill all enemies in that level using his blade or environmental traps. The player character can deflect bullets with his slash, slow time with a meter that slowly refills, and dodge attacks using rolls. The game also features a real-time conversation system that the player can interrupt.

## Neumékca City Project with Huobi ECO Chain
Huobi ECO Chain (Heco) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain, also the first product launched by the Huobi Open Platform. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high-performance transactions. The endogenous token of Heco is HT and it adopts the HPoS consensus mechanism. Heco will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

And...
Neumékca City Project bring into focus on expand DeFi ecosystem on Huobi ECO Chain. While DeFi is perceived by many as the utopia of the future of financial markets, the system still operates within an unregulated environment. It’s time to move forward. Neumékca City Project is an AMM protocol but is on Huobi ECO Chain.

For the market to gain mainstream acceptance, consumers and corporations will need to see cryptocurrency as a user-friendly solution to their common transactions. Also, the industry will need to develop cybersecurity technology and protocols. We propose a Speculative AMM as a method, which to mitigate the issue of overspeculation 'smoothes out' strong price fluctuations. Funnily enough, Uniswap’s creators are still trying to figure out exactly why passive market making on Uniswap works. But in Newmekca City Project, it feels more like exploring different possibilities and experimenting with new strategies. Its fun.
