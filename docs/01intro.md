## About Katana Zero
:::note
Katana Zero is a 2D action platform video game developed by Askiisoft and published by Devolver Digital for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Nintendo Switch in 2019. The game was also released on Xbox One on October 15, 2020.
Katana Zero includes no health bar and being hit will result in instant death. The player character navigates side-scrolling levels, attempting to kill all enemies in that level using his blade or environmental traps. The player character can deflect bullets with his slash, slow time with a meter that slowly refills, and dodge attacks using rolls. The game also features a real-time conversation system that the player can interrupt.

## Neumékca City Project with Huobi ECO Chain
Huobi ECO Chain (Heco) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain, also the first product launched by the Huobi Open Platform. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high-performance transactions. The endogenous token of Heco is HT and it adopts the HPoS consensus mechanism. Heco will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

And...
Neumékca City Project bring into focus on expand DeFi ecosystem on Huobi ECO Chain. While DeFi is perceived by many as the utopia of the future of financial markets, the system still operates within an unregulated environment. It’s time to move forward. Neumékca City Project is an AMM protocol but is on Huobi ECO Chain.

For the market to gain mainstream acceptance, consumers and corporations will need to see cryptocurrency as a user-friendly solution to their common transactions. Also, the industry will need to develop cybersecurity technology and protocols. We propose a Speculative AMM as a method, which to mitigate the issue of overspeculation 'smoothes out' strong price fluctuations. Funnily enough, Uniswap’s creators are still trying to figure out exactly why passive market making on Uniswap works. But in Newmekca City Project, it feels more like exploring different possibilities and experimenting with new strategies. Its fun.

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com/ or <http://www.example.com/> and sometimes example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

## Code

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log('This line can be highlighted!');
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
