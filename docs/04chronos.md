:::info What is Chronos ?
Chronos was a drug created by Leon Von Alvensleben for the Neumékca government in order to create super soldiers for the NULL project. Chronos provides the NULL soldiers with limited precognition, allowing them to preplan the outcomes of combat. It also allows for them to slow their perception of time and rewind time to a certain point.
However, Chronos has severe side effects, including vivid hallucinations. If a Chronos user goes through withdrawal, they not only die a painful death, but are also stuck inside of a time loop within their minds, stuck in eternal agony as they relive the moment of their death again and again.

:::caution
Participants in the NULL program would be chosen based on their lack of empathy whilst killing, with psychopathic participants being prominent. They would undergo training in a secret government facility disguised as a Slaughterhouse in the Third District, overseen by Leon Von Alvensleben.  They fell into three categories in ascending order of skill, as well as exposure to Chronos:
1. Alpha NULL - 7% of all Alpha NULL survived the training program.
1. Beta NULL - 13% of all Beta NULL survived the training program.
1. Gamma NULL - The most rigorous of all NULL programs, Gamma NULL were trained and given Chronos since childhood to develop their ability to predict the future as well as hone their combat expertise. Every Gamma NULL survived the training program.

**What is NULL-soldier's skill in the katana-zero? NULL-skill demonstrates the proficiency level of battle control skill of NULL-soldiers. Therefore the NULL-soldiers are ranked by three levels: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.**
:::tip In the Neumékca City Project, a NULL-skill is used to determine the percentage of rewards shared among users, as shown in the formula below.

> ### Each user starts with 14 CHRONOS and is incremented by 49% every day until the maximum number of CHRONOS is reached (the number of skills of NULL-soldiers is proportional to the number of CHRONOS injected).
>
> - Alpha: users with the most staked amount
-- MAXIMUM CHRONOS INJECTED = 31
> - Beta: user with the smallest staked amount
-- MAXIMUM CHRONOS INJECTED = 96
> - Gamma: users with the intermediate staked amount
-- MAXIMUM CHRONOS INJECTED = 179

> *In addition, the use of NFT cards also helps the user to increase the number of skills faster (like chronos injection).*

The number users of three range are depended on the total users as below:

| Total users |    Alpha 7%   |     Beta 13%    |   Gamma 80%  |
| :----:      |    :----:     |    :----:       |    :----:    |
| 0-99        |     0-7       |       8-20      |       >20    |
| 100-199     |   0-14        |      15-40      |    >40       |
| 200-299     |    0-21       |      22-60      |    >60       |
| 300-399     |   0-28        |     29-80       |    >80       |
| 400-499     |    0-35       |      36-100     |    >100      |
| >500        |   0-42        |     43-120      |    >120      |
:::danger Additional Mining Notes:
1. 10% of the mining rewards from users will be allocated and distributed to the dividend pool (to be distributed to ZERO holders).
1. IMPORTANT: ZERO tokens will undergo a 5% deduction from all trades. From this 5%, 2.5% of it will be burned and the remaining 2.5% will be transferred to the dividend pool (to be distributed to ZERO holders). Keep HODL ZERO guys !!!
